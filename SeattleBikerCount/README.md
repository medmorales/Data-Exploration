# A Short Exploratory Analysis On Biker Count in Seattle
As a recent graduate from UC Davis, a school big on bike riding, I wanted to see what a potential visualization of bike riders passing through a point would be like. I found similar data to this @ https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bike-program/bike-counters. 

# Contents
* `EDA#1.pynb`: Data exploration on the biker count passing through Broadway Cycle Track North Of E Union St in Seattle to find daily, weekly and monthly trends in rider usage. I use `pandas` to read in the data and a combination of `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to visualize the time series data. 
* Data: Used `urllib.request` to retrieve data from the Seattle Dpartment of Transportation's website.
